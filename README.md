# prework study guide

## Description
This study guide was created as a resource for students who are learning how to code. It was made to allow students to refer to when they wanted to revise their knowledge on a the following topics: 
- html
- css
- java script
- git

The main issue that it solves is having to waste time looking for a good website with extensive notes on these topics. 
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

it has 4 different topics that all have different notes. the html topic contains notes on the different elements and what they do. the css topic contains notes on the different styling properties and how they are used. the git topic contains notes on the different git commands and how to use them. and the java script section contains notes on what the different commands do and how functions and if statements work. when you access the website and open the devtools console, it will list the 4 topics and randomly pick one for you to revise.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
